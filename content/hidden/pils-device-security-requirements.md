PrisonPC PILS client devices need to be protected against the many threats from hostile prison inmates including storage of physical contraband, electronic contraband, booting from illicit media, clandestine communication, and so on. Common-off-the-shelf consumer-grade devices do not provide sufficient protection against these threats and are therefore unsuitable in correctional facilities.

Detailed information on the potential threats of in-cell interactive technology can be found in [Designing Secure Prisoner Computer Systems](https://www.prisonpc.com/design-book).
